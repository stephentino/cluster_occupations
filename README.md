# Defining labor markets using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and task descriptions

## About this repository

The purpose of this project is to improve upon existing definitions of labor markets by using methods from Natural Language Processing (NLP). I define labor markets in a novel way by clustering occupations based on their task descriptions.

At the core of many papers in labour economics is the definition of the labour market. For example, many papers implicitly define labor markets using industry standard industry classification, such as NAICS. However, it is possible that true labour market boundaries do not perfectly overlap with standard industry classification. It is possible that researchers arrive at different conclusions in their studies if they adopt different definitions of the
labour market in their analyses.
