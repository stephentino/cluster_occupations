# About this repository

At the core of many papers in labour economics is the definition of the labour market. For example,
in a seminal work on the effects of immigration, Borjas (2003) argued that labour markets are
appropriately defined as groups of workers with similar education and experience. Borjasâ€™
conclusions about the effects of immigration in that paper depend heavily on the labour market
definition. Other studies in the immigration literature (e.g., Ottaviano et al., 2016) implicitly define
labour markets at the industry-year level. However, it is possible that true labour market
boundaries do not perfectly overlap with standard industry classification. It is possible that
researchers arrive at different conclusions in their studies if they adopt different definitions of the
labour market in their analyses.

This project aims to improve upon existing definitions of labor markets by using methods from Natural Language Processing (NLP). I define labor markets in a novel way by clustering occupations based on their task descriptions.
