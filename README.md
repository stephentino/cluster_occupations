# Defining labor markets using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and task descriptions

## About this repository

The purpose of this project is to improve upon existing definitions of labor markets by using methods from Natural Language Processing (NLP). I define labor markets in a novel way by clustering occupations based on their task descriptions.

## Background information

At the core of many papers in labour economics is the definition of the labour market. For example,
in a seminal work on the effects of immigration, Borjas (2003) argued that labour markets are
appropriately defined as groups of workers with similar education and experience. Borjas’
conclusions about the effects of immigration in that paper depend heavily on the labour market
definition. Other studies in the immigration literature (e.g., Ottaviano et al., 2016) implicitly define
labour markets at the industry-year level. However, it is possible that true labour market
boundaries do not perfectly overlap with standard industry classification, and that researchers would arrive at different conclusions in their studies if they adopt different definitions of the
labour market in their analyses.

In this project, I use methods from Natural Language Processing (NLP) to cluster occupations based on their
task descriptions. My ultimate goal is to define a ``labor market”. Specifically in my context, a ``labor market” is a
cluster of occupations for which (a) the tasks of all of the occupations are similar and (b) the
workers of these occupations have similar abilities, education, and experience.
